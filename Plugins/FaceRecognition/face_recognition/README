Intro:
------
The program expects a set of face images in a subdirectory of the execution directory 
named 'att_faces'. This face database can be freely downloaded from the Cambridge 
University Copmputer Lab's website:

     http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/dtg/attarchive/facedatabase.html

Usage:
------
    eigenfacetest [-vs] [-t training image list] [-r test images list]
        -v: Verbose mode.
        -s: The projected face vectors can be retrieved and rendered
            as images. This option shows the average face and a 
            few of the eigenfaces.
        -r: A list of test files with faces to try and recognize.
        -t: A List of training files with faces to... well... train on.

Running without any options causes the program to parse the test_original.txt and
train_original.txt files.
